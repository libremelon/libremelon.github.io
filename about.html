<p>Hey, I am</p>

  <div id="pixel-strong">libremelon</div>
</h1>
<p>
  I'm into programming, art and music, which are my favorite creative outlets.
  At present, I'm a first year CSE undergrad that's exploring software
  development on a broad scale. I might deeply commit to a specific domain
  someday but I'm having fun with the way things are right now.
</p>
<p>
  I am a big fan of free/libre open source software and try to use and support
  it whenever I can. Oh and I also love indie games.
</p>
<p>
  I post stuff that I find cool and random progress logs on my socials. Longer
  thoughts and deep dives will go up on my blog.

  Btw if you're on discord, you might consider joining my little discord server
  where you can find me and other cool peeps who share similar interests:
